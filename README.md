# TDEditor
The Editor Tools for Terry Defense


WARNING: Currently it doesn't compile because i had to copy the inspector folder and Editor folder from the Base Tools addons.
compile fix is simply to copy those folders into this one so it can find the components, this will likely fix itself in the near future.


you need the gamemode to be able to launch this tool
